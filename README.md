# üêç Simple Scraping BSE with Python
> Because manual work is so last decade.

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why?
So here‚Äôs the thing.

At my company (vendor btw), they regularly check the government website to download BSE ‚Äî aka *Buku Sekolah Elektronik*, aka *Buku Penggerak*.

Sounds normal, right?
**WRONG.**

Instead of using any sort of script, tool, or even basic common sense, they manually right-click each book link, copy it, and paste it into Excel.
One. By. One.

It‚Äôs like watching someone wash a car with a toothbrush. Noble, but deeply unnecessary.

But wait ‚Äî it gets better.

One of the BSE sources?
Yeah, it has a public REST API.
Like‚Ä¶ wide open. Just sitting there. Waiting.
Begging to be used.

And yet‚Ä¶
They chose violence.
They chose the Way of the Mouse.

So here I am, building a scraper out of pure confusion and secondhand frustration.
Because someone had to stop the madness.

Because really:
**Why do it manually when you can automate it once and chill forever?**
